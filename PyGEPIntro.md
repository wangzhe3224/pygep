# What is it? #
PyGEP is a simple library suitable for academic study of GEP (Gene Expression Programming) in Python, aiming for ease of use and rapid implementation.

# What does it do? #
PyGEP provide an implementation of most standard GEP components:
  * ApiChromosomes: unigenic and multigenic chromosomes
  * ApiPopulations: populations and generational cycling
  * ApiFunctionLibraries: libraries for arithmetic, logic and comparison non-terminal functions
  * ApiLinkers: multigenic linker functions

# How do I use it? #
There are a couple [demos](http://pygep.googlecode.com/svn/tags/pygep-0.1-beta/src/demo/) available based on those in [the papers of Ferreira](http://gene-expression-programming.com/GEPBiblio.asp).  For a quick start see the SymbolicRegressionTutorial.
