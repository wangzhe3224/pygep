# About PyGEP #
PyGEP is a simple library suitable for academic study of GEP (Gene Expression Programming) in Python 2.5, aiming for ease of use and rapid implementation.  It provides standard multigenic chromosomes; a population class using elitism and fitness scaling for selection; mutation, crossover and transposition operators; and some standard GEP functions and linkers.

PyGEP is intended for research, not commercial application.  Those interested in a full GEP system are advised to visit [Gepsoft](http://www.gepsoft.com/associatesclick.asp?pygep-01), makers of [GeneXproTools](http://www.gepsoft.com/associatesclick.asp?pygep-01).
